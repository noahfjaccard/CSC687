This project set out to understand Streaming Service data. The goal of the project to understand what genres and types of content fit each kind of streaming service. There are two audinece for our project: potential streaming service customers and content creators. For potential customers the dataset shows what kind of serivices have certain kinds of genres. The main target audience is content creators. This tool will help them understand which service their content fits into the most.
